Meet Aidan, an Irish lad with a simple dream: collect coins and catch as many pints of Guinness as humanly possible while running through the countryside. Why? Because it's Ireland, that's why.

Jump over suspiciously aggressive mushrooms, dodge flying crates, and leap onto floating platforms that definitely passed safety inspections. Every 10 coins, a magical Guinness appears. Catch it for glory! Miss it and the universe punishes you with SPEED.

One hit and Aidan explodes into a spectacular fireball. Very dramatic.

Controls: SPACE to jump, A/D to stumble left and right.

Sláinte! 🍀
